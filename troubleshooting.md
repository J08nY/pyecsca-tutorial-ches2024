## I can not install `requirements.txt`

For some reason (likely the Python version), you are unable
to install the requirements from `requirements.txt`.

### Solution

Install the requirements from `requirements.in` which are not
pinned to concrete versions.

## I see empty space instead of plots

You are not seeing any plots even in cells that should have them.

### Solution

What may be happening is that Bokeh (the plotting library we are using)
requires loading some JavaScript on the client side. This JavaScript load
may not work in case you do not have a reliable Internet connection or have
some browser extensions that are blocking it.

Make sure you have a reliable Internet connection while working with the notebook
(especially while running the cell that contains the `hv.extension("bokeh")` call)
and make sure no requests like this are blocked.

You can check the browser developer tools console for the dropped requests.

## I see `:DynamicMap   []` instead of plots

You are seeing `:DynamicMap   []` in place of plots.

### Solution

Run the cell that contains the `hv.extension("bokeh")` call (usually one of the first)
that initializes the plotting library.

## KeyError: 'content'

You are getting cryptic error messages when trying to plot (any `plot_trace` call):
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/virt/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pyviz_comms/init.py", line 340, in _handle_msg
	self._on_msg(msg)
File "/virt/lib/python3.12/site-packages/panel/viewable.py", line 469, in _on_msg
	patch = manager.assemble(msg)
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
File "/virt/lib/python3.12/site-packages/panel/models/comm_manager.py", line 29, in assemble
	msg_obj = cls(header, msg['metadata'], msg['content'])
                                           ~~~^^^^^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'content'
```

### Solution

1. Save your work (`Ctrl + S`). Do this for all open notebooks.
2. Clear all outputs -> *Edit* -> *Clear Outputs of All Cells*.
3. Stop Jupyter Lab (or Notebook) -> *File* -> *Shut Down*.
4. Run `find . -name ".ipynb_checkpoints" -exec rm -r "{}" +` in the repository.
5. Start Jupyter Lab (or Notebook) back again:
   `python -m jupyter lab` or `python -m jupyter notebook`.
