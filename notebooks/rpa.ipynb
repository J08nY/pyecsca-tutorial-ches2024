    " - Multipliers differ in their \"intermediate scalars\" that they compute while computing a scalarmult.\n",
    "     - How to explore this?\n",
    "     - LTR vs RTL? prefixes vs suffixes vs windows?\n",
    " - In the RPA attack, which attacks static ECDH, one is able to detect a particular multiple of the input point is computed, by crafting a special input point and using a power side-channel.\n",
    "     - How to explore this?\n",
    "     - It is an \"oracle\", you are able to ask questions like \"is $[k]P$ computed in a given implementation when it is doing scalarmult of $[r]P$?\"\n",
    "     - Show the RPA attack. Existence of $P_0$ point, then, when you do $[k^{-1}]P_0 = P$ you get a point such that $[k]P = [k][k^{-1}]P_0 = P_0$. Then get two groups of traces of the implementation computing scalarmult with a secret (fixed) scalar, one group with random input points, other with point $P$ for some $k$. If $[k]P$ is computed, you will see a difference between these two groups at some point, because of the zero coordinate. To spot the difference, basically do DPA: average the groups and subtract their average traces, then see spike (peak detect or threshold).\n",
    " - Putting these two things together, we see that we can build a reverse-engineering method out of them."

    "## RPA attack\n",
    "The RPA attack (by Louis Goubin, [A Refined Power-Analysis Attack on Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems](http://www.goubin.fr/papers/ecc-dpa.pdf)) works by introducing a zero-coordinate-point into the scalar multiplication conditionally on a secret key part and then detecting the presence of the zero via a side-channel. The target is static ECDH, in which case there is a static scalar $k$ and the target is willing to compute $[k]P$ for any (reasonable) point $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smuggling the zero in\n",
    "\n",
    "In the attack, the existence of zero-coordinate points is important.\n",
    "They are either of the form $P_0 = (x, 0)$ or $P_0 = (0, y)$. The first form is less interesting, as it represents points of order 2, which are not present on prime-order elliptic curves often used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the attack, the attacker can introduces these zero-coordinate points into the scalar multiplication conditionally on some secret key hypothesis. Upon input of $P = [r^{-1}]P_0$ into the scalar multiplier, the point $P_0$ will appear inside iff the multiplier computes the $r$-th multiple of the input point, as $[r]P = [r][r^{-1}]P_0 = P_0$. In the attack, the attacker uses this to confirm hypotheses about parts of the secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detecting the zero\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a way of getting the zero in, we need a way of detecting it. We will use a power (or EM) side-channel and the fact that arithmetic operations with zero values will leak in a different way than operations with non-zero values. The diagram below shows the idea (which is very similar to DPA). We will collect two groups of traces, one with the special point $P=[r^{-1}]P_0$ and one with random points $P$ input into the target. We will then average the traces in the two groups and subtract the average traces to form a Difference-of-Means (DoM) trace. If this traces has a peak we were able to distinguish between the two groups, which implies that the zero did occur in the \"special point $P$\" group, which in turn implies that the scalar multiplier computed the $r$-th multiple of the input point.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/rpa.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nuances\n",
    "\n",
    "The RPA attack will not work in the presence of scalar randomization countermeasures, as these effectively randomize the sequence of multiples computed while computing the $[k]P$. However, the attack is resistant against coordinate and curve randomization, because the zero-coordinate points resist randomization."
