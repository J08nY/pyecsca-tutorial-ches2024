# Side-channel-based Reverse-Engineering of ECC implementations

[![pyecsca](notebooks/img/logo_black_full.png)](https://pyecsca.org)

Welcome to the *Side-channel-based Reverse-Engineering of ECC implementations* tutorial.

During this tutorial you will learn why it makes sense to reverse-engineer ECC implementations,
what ECC implementations look like and how to actually reverse-engineer them automatically using
side-channel analysis.

See the [setup](setup.md) instructions, if something doesn't work see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

Read [the paper](https://pyecsca.org/papers.html?utm_source=tutorial-ches2024#pyecsca-reverse-engineering-black-box-elliptic-curve-cryptography-via-side-channel-analysis) for more.
