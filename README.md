# Reverse-Engineering ECC implementations Using Side-Channel Analysis

[![pyecsca](notebooks/img/logo_black_full.png)](https://neuromancer.sk/pyecsca/)

Welcome to the *Reverse-Engineering ECC implementations Using Side-Channel Analysis* tutorial.

During this tutorial you will learn why it makes sense to reverse-engineer ECC implementations,
what ECC implementations look like and how to actually reverse-engineer them automatically using
side-channel analysis.

See the [setup](setup.md) instructions, if something doesn't work see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
