# Side-channel-based Reverse-Engineering of ECC implementations

[![pyecsca](notebooks/img/logo_black_full.png)](https://pyecsca.org)

Welcome to the *Side-channel-based Reverse-Engineering of ECC implementations* tutorial.

During this tutorial you will learn why it makes sense to reverse-engineer ECC implementations,
what ECC implementations look like and how to actually reverse-engineer them automatically using
side-channel analysis.

See the [setup](setup.md) instructions, if something doesn't work see [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).
