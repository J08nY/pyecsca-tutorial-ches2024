# Tutorial

First of all, make sure that you have everything ready as per the installation.md file.

## 1. Quickstart

Activate the virtualenv where you have installed the dependencies (or the pre-created one in the VM):
```
. virt/bin/activate
```

Start the Jupyter notebook server by running:
```
jupyter notebook
```
inside this repository.

Open the [start](notebooks/start.ipynb) notebook and play with its cells.
